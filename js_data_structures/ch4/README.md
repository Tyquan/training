# ABSTRACT	DATA	TYPE	& JAVASCRIPT	COLLECTIONS

> An	abstract	data	type	(ADT)	is	a	logical	description	of	how	we	view	the	data	and	the	operations	that	are allowed	on	it.	ADT	is	defined	as	a	user	point	of	view	of	a	data	type.	ADT	concerns	about	the	possible values	of	the	data	and	what	are	interface	exposed	by	it.

> ADT	does	not	concern	about	the	actual	implementation	of	the	data	structure.
