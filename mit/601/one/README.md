## Primitives, Composition, Abstraction, and Patterns

### Data
> The primitive data items in most programming languages are things like integers, floating point numbers, and strings. We can combine these into data structures Like Lists, arrays, dictionairies and records. Sometimes we just want to look at data, not in terms of its underlying representation, but in terms of what they respresent. 
> Abstract Data Types prodives a way of abstracting away from representaional details and allowing us to focus on what the data really means

### Procedures
> If we want to abstract away from the details of how a paticular computation is done, we can define a new function. Defining a function allows us to use it for computational jobs without thinking about the details of how these computational jobs get done.
> One way to capture common patterns of abstraction in procedures is to abstract over procedures themselves, with higher order functions.

### Objects
> At the most basic level objects can be used as records, combining together primitive data elements. 
> More generally they provide strategies for jointly absracting a data representation and the procedures that work on it.

## Expressions and Assignment
> To represent data in a computer, we have to encode it, ultimately as sequences of binary digits (0,1). 
> A computer at its lowest level, is a set of primitive instructions. These instructions spcify operations to be performed on the data that are stored in the computers memory.
