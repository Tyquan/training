# State Machines
>  State machines model systems that are functional, but also have memory. State machines are incredibly general, but incredibly powerful, and can be used to model all kinds of systems
> You can use state machines to control, model, and predict behaviors in systems.

> Practice 
    * class SM 
        o  start 
        o  step 
        o  transduce 
        o  startState 
        o  getNextValues 
    * Soar 
        o Brain 
        o Simulator/Pioneer 
        o Sonars 
        o  rvel/fvel

> After this week in 6.01, you should be familiar with the following: 
    * Theory: you should understand: 
        - OOP and different paradigms 
        - State Machines: State transition diagrams, transition tables, expression as math equations 
        - Simple block diagrams 
    * Practice: you should be able to: 
        - Locate the 6.01 Software Documentation, and use it effectively
        - Run a robot using Soar, both in Simulation and Pioneer modes 
        - Implement a state machine to control robot behavior using a custom SM.
