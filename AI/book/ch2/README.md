> An AGENT is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators

> For Example: Humans are Agents ( A human agent has eyes, ears, and other organs for sensors and hands, legs, and so on for actuators)

> A robotic agent might have cameras and infrared range ﬁnders for sensors and various motors for actuators

> A software agent receives keystrokes, ﬁle contents, and network packets as sensory inputs and acts on the environment by displaying on the screen, writing ﬁles, and sending network packets. 

> An Agent Runs in Cycles: 1) Perceive Environment 2.) Thinks 3.) Act on Environment
 
> PERCEPTs refer to the Agents perceptual Inputs at any given instant.
