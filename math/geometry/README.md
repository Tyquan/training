# Geometry

> Study of the measurment of Earth and Shape

. or (.) - Point

> Example .A 	.B 	.C  => Point A , Point B , Point C  

> When we connect these points  the line is called a line sgment
> The points at the end of the line segments are callled end points (Point A to Point B has a line segment and the points are endpoints)

	Example:
		A---------B
		A and B are endpoints
		--- is a line segment

> Line segements end at the end points
> Lines never end

> Angle at 90 degrees => Right Angle
> Angle under 90 degrees => Acute Angle
> Angle Above 90 degrees => Obtuse Angle
