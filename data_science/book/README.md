> Data science lies at the intersection of: 
    • Hacking skills 
    • Math and statistics knowledge 
    • Substantive expertise 

> By reading this book, you will get a good understanding of the way I hack on things, which may not necessarily be the best way for you to hack on things. You will get a good understanding of some of the tools I use, which will not necessarily be the best tools for you to use. You will get a good understanding of the way I approach data problems, which may not necessarily be the best way for you to approach data 

> you can’t really do data science without some understanding of probability and statistics and linear algebra.

## From Scratch 

> There are lots and lots of data science libraries, frameworks, modules, and toolkits that efficiently implement the most common (as well as the least common) data science algorithms and techniques. If you become a data scientist, you will become intimately familiar with NumPy, with scikit-learn, with pandas, and with a panoply of other libraries. They are great for doing data science. But they are also a good way to start doing data science without actually understanding data science. 

> In this book, we will be approaching data science from scratch. That means we’ll be building tools and implementing algorithms by hand in order to better understand them.

> Python has several features that make it well suited for learning (and doing) data science: 
    • It’s free. 
    • It’s relatively simple to code in (and, in particular, to understand). 
    • It has lots of useful data science–related libraries.
