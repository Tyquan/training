# Types of Data

	1. Numerical
	2. Categorical
	3. Ordinal

## Numerical Data
> It represents	some quantifiable thing	that you can measure. Some examples	are	heights	of people,	page load times, stock prices, and so on. Things that vary,	things that	you	can	measure, things	that have a	wide range of possibilities.

### Discrete Data
> can	be	counts	of	some	sort	of	event.	Some examples	are	how	many	purchases	did	a	customer	make	in	a	year.	Well,	that	can	only	be	discrete	values. They	bought	one	thing,	or	they	bought	two	things,	or	they	bought	three	things.	They	couldn't	have	bought, 2.25	things	or	three	and	three-quarters	things.

### Continuous Data
> This	is	stuff	that	has	an	infinite	range	of possibilities	where	you	can	go	into	fractions.	So,	for	example,	going	back	to	the	height	of	people,	there	is an	infinite	number	of	possible	heights	for	people.	You	could	be	five	feet	and	10.37625	inches	tall,	or	the time	it	takes	to	do	something	like	check	out	on	a	website	could	be	any	huge	range	of	possibilities,	10.7625 seconds	for	all	you	know,	or	how	much	rainfall	in	a	given	day.	Again,	there's	an	infinite	amount	of precision	there.	So	that's	an	example	of	continuous	data.


## Categorical Data
> Most	of	the	time,	you	can't	really	compare	one	category	to	another	directly.	Things	like	gender,	yes/no questions,	race,	state	of	residence,	product	category,	political	party;	you	can	assign	numbers	to	these categories,	and	often	you	will,	but	those	numbers	have	no	inherent	meaning.

> So,	for	example,	I	can	say	that	the	area	of	Texas	is	greater	than	the	area	of	Florida,	but	I	can't	just	say Texas	is	greater	than	Florida,	they're	just	categories.	There's	no	real	numerical	quantifiable	meaning	to them,	it's	just	ways	that	we	categorize	different	things.
Now	again,	I	might	have	some	sort	of	numerical	assignation	to	each	state.	I	mean,	I	could	say	that	Florida is	state	number	3	and	Texas	state	number	4,	but	there's	no	real	relationship	between	3	and	4	there,	right, it's	just	a	shorthand	to	more	compactly	represent	these	categories.	So	again,	categorical	data	does	not have	any	intrinsic	numerical	meaning;	it's	just	a	way	that	you're	choosing	to	split	up	a	set	of	data	based	on categories.

## Ordinal Data
> 	it's	sort	of	a	mixture	of numerical	and	categorical	data.	A	common	example	is	star	ratings	for	a	movie	or	music,	or	what	have you.

> In	this	case,	we	have	categorical	data	in	that	could	be	1	through	5	stars,	where	1	might	represent	poor	and 5	might	represent	excellent,	but	they	do	have	mathematical	meaning.	We	do	know	that	5	means	it's	better than	a	1,	so	this	is	a	case	where	we	have	data	where	the	different	categories	have	a	numerical	relationship to	each	other.	So,	I	can	say	that	1	star	is	less	than	5	stars,	I	can	say	that	2	stars	is	less	than	3	stars,	I	can say	that	4	stars	is	greater	than	2	stars	in	terms	of	a	measure	of	quality.	Now	you	could	also	think	of	the actual	number	of	stars	as	discrete	numerical	data.	So,	it's	definitely	a	fine	line	between	these	categories, and	in	a	lot	of	cases	you	can	actually	treat	them	interchangeably
