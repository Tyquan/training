# Exploring the 20 Newsgroups Dataset with Text Analysis Algorithms

> starting from this chapter as the second step of our learning journal, we will be discovering in detail several import machine learning algorithms and techniques

> Questions to answer:
	* What is NLP and what are its applications? 
	* Touring Python NLP libraries 
	* Natural Language Toolkit and common NLP tasks 
	* The newsgroups data 
	* Getting the data Thinking about features 
	* Visualizing the data 
	* Data preprocessing: tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization 
	* Clustering and unsupervised learning 
	* k-means clustering Non-negative matrix factorization 
	* Topic modeling
